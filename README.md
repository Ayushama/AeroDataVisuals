# Acknowledgement
 I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to my Data Analyst teacher "Mr. Abhishek Saraswat" for their able guidance and suppert in completing my project. I would also like to extend my gratitude to all staff, my project buddy for providing me the support.
 
# Project Description:
 Welcome to the Check My Flight project! This project dives deep into flight price data, helping you understand the dynamics behind flight costs and providing predictions on future trends. We've utilized the power of Tableau to craft interactive visualizations, offering both granular details and broad trends to assist in forecasting and planning.
 
# Objectives of Analysis:
 1.	Extract Insights: Utilize Tableau to derive meaningful insights from complex flight price data.
 2.	Identify Trends: Examine changes in flight prices over time to detect patterns.
 3.	Create Visualizations: Develop clear, informative visualizations that depict historical pricing trends.
 4.	Forecast Prices: Use historical data to anticipate and model future flight pricing behaviors.

# Deliverables:
* This project delivers Comprehensive Report:
  * An explanation of the data analysis approach and methodologies.
  * Visualizations that illustrate patterns and predictions in flight pricing.
  * Insights into the factors that influence flight prices.
  * The Tableau source code for the visualizations.
 
# Data Exploration: 
* Load and Explore: The dataset was loaded into Tableau to explore its structure and nuances.
* Clean and Transform: We addressed missing values and other data imperfections to ensure a clean dataset for analysis.
  
# Flight Price Analysis: 
* Trend Analysis: We created visualizations to track changes in flight prices over time.
* Identify Seasonal Patterns: We pinpointed seasonal variations, price fluctuations, and overall trends.

# Forecasting Future Patterns: 
* Visualization Forecasts: We developed visualizations that project future flight prices based on past data.
* Time Series Analysis: Applied historical data to model and predict future pricing trends.

# Factors Influencing Flight Prices: 
* Factor Exploration: Investigated how various factors like booking timing, destination choices, and airline preferences impact prices.
* Impact Visualization: Produced visualizations that clearly show how these factors influence flight costs.

# Documentation and Reporting: 
* Findings Summary: Compiled the insights and analyses into a coherent summary.
* Importance Explanation: Detailed why understanding these pricing patterns is crucial for travellers.

# Key Visualizations: 
  1.	**Flight Price Trend Over Time** : Line chart showing historical price trends.
  2.	**Comparison of Average vs. Total Travel Distance**: Scatter plot comparing travel distances.
  3.	**Total Travel Distance by Starting Airport**: Horizontal bar chart highlighting travel distances from various airports.
  4.	**Fare Distribution by Airline**: Line chart showing fare distributions across different airlines.
  5.	**Total Fares by Starting and Destination Airports**: Circle view chart illustrating fare trends based on airports.
  6.	**Total Fares vs. Travel Duration**: Bubble chart representing fares against travel duration.
  7.	**Base Fare and Total Fare Over Time**: Dual-axis chart showing base and total fares over time.
  8.	**Distribution of Cabin Classes**: Pie chart depicting the proportion of different cabin classes.
  9.	**Non-Stop vs. Connecting Flights**: Scatter plot comparing fares for non-stop and connecting flights.
  10.	**Refundable vs. Non-Refundable Fares**: Pie chart comparing refundable and non-refundable fares.

# Dashboard Overview:
The project comprises three interactive dashboards hosted on Tableau Public, each focusing on different aspects of flight data:
1. **Flight Trends and Pricing Analysis**:
  * Tracks and analyzes flight price trends over time.
  * Visualizes fare distribution by airline and travel duration effects on pricing.
